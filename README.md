# Weekend-Redux-Feedback-Loop

## Description
I Created a multi-part form that allows users to leave feedback for today. 
There are 4 views for the form parts. Each page has its own route to the next page when 'next' is clicked. A score must be provided to proceed to the next step.
The final page is a review page that once submitted takes the user to a final page that thanks them for their feedback. 
The last page has a button that will bring the user back to the 1st page to leave more feedback.
